"""Safe intake of farmer-supplied images.

Everything here treats the upload as hostile input. The defences, and what each
one is for:

  streaming size cap  -- an attacker must not be able to exhaust memory by
                         sending a file larger than we ever intended to hold.
  magic-byte sniffing -- the multipart Content-Type header is chosen by the
                         client and cannot be trusted.
  pixel-count limit   -- a small compressed file can declare enormous dimensions
                         ("decompression bomb") and blow up memory on decode.
  decode + re-encode  -- destroys anything hidden alongside the image data:
                         polyglot HTML/SVG payloads, appended archives, and all
                         EXIF metadata (which on a phone photo includes the GPS
                         coordinates of the farm).
